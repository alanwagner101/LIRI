# LIRI

This is a command line application using NodeJS.

After locating the root folder and entering node liri.js you then have the opportunity to enter 2 different arguments.
First you can enter either spotify-this-song , movie-this , conert-this , do-what-it-says.
Secondly you can enter either a song, movie, band, or have the text thats logged in random.txt run.

Based off of the input entered it will run an api request from either Spotify, OMDB, or Bands In Town and return information about the song, movie, or band that you entered. 

It also logs that information into another text file named log.txt for later inspection.
